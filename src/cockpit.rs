//! The page, and the joins between what the server sends and what the page reads.
//!
//! The page is one HTML file compiled into the binary, and it is here rather than in
//! `skein-server` for a reason the tests below make concrete: **nothing in the language connects a
//! field the server serialises to the name the page reads.** Rename one side and the feature does
//! not break loudly — the button never appears, the voice goes quiet — which looks exactly like
//! "nothing needed you", the state these features exist to distinguish from silence.
//!
//! So each join is asserted, in both directions, next to the asset that carries it. The browser
//! smoke tests cannot cover most of them (their fixture box belongs to no repo, so the flags are
//! always false), which is why these are here and not left to a reader.
//!
//! The vendored scripts stay in the binary: they are bytes to hand out, and no join runs through
//! them.

/// The cockpit page. One owner, so the server and the tests below cannot disagree about which
/// bytes are the page.
